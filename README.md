# Simple RESTful Blog

Author: Jay Song

Date: Dec. 21, 2017

### Description
A very simple web app allowing me to make/edit/delete blog posts with a title, an image link, and a body (HTML allowed).
Made with Node.js and Express. MongoDB used through Mongoose.

Made as a practice using REST routes: Index, New, Create, Edit, Update, Destroy
